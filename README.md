# Calculation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and heat capacities from DFT results
Calculation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and heat capacities (i.e. all material-specific quantities required for a two-temperature model) from density functional theory results (electron and phonon densities of states, Eliashberg function)
