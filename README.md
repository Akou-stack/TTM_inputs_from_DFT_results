# Calculation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and heat capacities from DFT results
Scripts to calculate the electron-phonon coupling parameter and heat capacities (i.e. the material-specific quantities required for a two-temperature model or similar energy flow models) from density functional theory (DFT) results. The following DFT results are required: electron and phonon densities of states, Eliashberg function, Fermi energy. Examples are provided for the case of both spin-resolved and non-spin-resolved DFT calculations.
